launchy_htpc_theme
==================

A Launchy theme for use on a bigger screen. See also http://www.launchy.net/, http://blog.daynemay.com/2012/04/htpc/

Installation:
=============
Put the HTPC folder into your Launchy skins directory.

On a random selection of boxes that I have used, this has been:

* Windows XP: C:\Program Files\Launchy\skins\
* Windows 7: C:\Program Files (x86)\Launchy\skins\
